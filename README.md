Hello! 

My name is Logan and I will have a bachelor's in CS from the University of Puget Sound in Spring of 2022. This is a repository to store a lot of my projects and code across my coding experiences! I am versed in C, Java, HTML, CSS and Java Script. I am currently working on learning C++.

Please do not copy code for commercial use!
